Neptical
========
A robust test framework designed to create lightweight easy to read tests.


It provides a simple spi to easly integrate already existing testing techniques and tooling

And its main goal is to tie your test systems to your code rather than the other way around.

It does not seek to replace your current tooling, but enhance your usages of it.

0.0.1 is near its incubation end - at that point I will release the api and show all the neat stuff Neptical can help you do in your day to day development life. The early stages of Neptical are focused on early api development, api stabilization and workstation friendly "good enough" performance tests.

0.0.1 features a module system, an easy to use spi, and a data mocking api that really makes it easy to start every test with:

@Test
public void muhahahhaIcanDoWhateverIwant

The api aims to provide focus on integrating ideas rather than apis. 

There is alot of tooling out there to setup and build complex test scenarios, the issue is... alot of times in an api its difficult to maintain these scenarios as the usages of the api's become more complex.

Neptical aims to provide the api developer tools to get the idea built in a domain specific data driven way.


Api documentation coming soon!
